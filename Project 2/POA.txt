All I have to do is find a related library in Java which save/convert the information to date format and then since the abstract class already including variables with the date format we just need to use those to store the information. 	Since we are using the same main code it will be easier to start from main. To do so we can start with creating the cases which the command line includes the “-textFile” command. This requires adding the condition case to the list of condition and creating a new flag and a new variable to store the name/path of the file. After doing so it is time to edit the REAMME part and add the new command.	Next step is to create a new class called TextDumper which implements AppointmentBookDumper. Text Dumper will save the information of the appointments from the appointmentBook in a format which each peace of information related to a specific appointment is separated by “;” and there is new line at the end of each one. This will make is easier to both save the information to an external txt file easier also while reading the information from a text file we will know how to separate and save the information.	After Text Dumper class is time to implement the Text Parser class, similar to text dumper this class will implement appointmentBookParser. The job of the parser is to separate the information which has been imported from a text file by “;” and then save them in the correct position in an appointment class.After implementing all of the above, its time use the two above classes to read a file and parse the file read and the use the dumper to dump the information in the file at the end and catch any errors.
