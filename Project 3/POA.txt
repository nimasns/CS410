First step will be the to troubleshoot the problems and get them fixed. Mainly the issue was the initial value for the dates. The format of the date is not 100% correct and needs to be modified to satisfy the test. Another issue is while reading the time from a file it wont recognize the time correctly.	Most of the first task of the project 3 is completed. All its left for the first part is to modify the format of the begin/end TimeString to use DateFormat.SHORT. I don’t have much experience with DateFormat.short so I need to do some research to better understand it.	Second task is to organize the appointments chronologically by beginning time. For doing this, after storing all of the information. Before recoding the data into the text file use an sorting library to sort the data by begin date and if the begin date is the same it will use ending time and if they are the same too, by the description. Using the compare library it will be possible.	Third task is the pretty printing which will include the duration of the appointments in minutes. To calculate the during of the duration we need to subtract the end time from the begin time. As far as pretty printing goes it will be separated by vertical lines or slashes and there will be title for each of the sections before printing out the data.	At last it is time to modify the –README to print the appropriate command lines. And also modify the main function to store the data correctly and be able to recognize the new command line (pretty printing) command.
